# Graphical Languages Concepts Notebook

The aim of this notebook is to sift through and organize research papers, real world examples, and comparisons of visual programming languages. Ultimatly the goal of this project is to determine where visual programming languages are most effective and worth thier cost to create. 

## List of Popular Visual Languages I want to Research

- TraceLab
- Labview
- Scratch
- Unity
- Luna (http://www.luna-lang.org/)
- Blocky (https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
- Unreal Engine Blueprints

## Categories of Visual Languages

- General-purpose languages
- Database languages
- Image-processing languages
- Scientific visualization languages
- User-interface generation languages
- Languages for programming web-based applications
- Languages for education

## Notes

Visual programming languages are based on nodes and interconnecting wires to graph relations between nodes.  One observation is that while the nodes can be layed out in an order that makes sense, often the interconnected wires make the visual representation look messy.  There are four types of intercepts I've seen so far:

- Stright lines (ex. tracelab) <image>
- right angle lines (ex. labview) <image>
- spline curves (ex. blueprints) <image>
- puzzle (ex. blocky) <image>
